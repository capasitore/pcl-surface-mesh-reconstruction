  AUTHOR={Fischler, Martin A. and Bolles, Robert C.},
  TITLE={Random Sample Consensus: A Paradigm for Model Fitting with Applications
     to Image Analysis and Automated Cartography},
  JOURNAL={Communications of the ACM},
  PAGES={381-395},
  NUMBER={6},
  VOLUME={24},
  YEAR={1981},
  ABSTRACT={A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model
     to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing
     data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally
     suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is
     based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion
     of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination
     Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with know locations,
     determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response
     to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks
     needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these
     minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis
     for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing.}
