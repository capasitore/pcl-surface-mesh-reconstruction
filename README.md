## PCL - surface - mesh reconstruction

This is a repository for my master's thesis. Here you can find program
```mesh-reconstruction``` which uses ```PCL``` (Point Cloud Library) to
construct mesh of triangles from pointcloud obtained with Microsoft
Kineckt camera and RGBDSlam program.

The purpose is to have 3D model of objects and scenes from multiple
views. 

My task is to evaluate functionality and quality of described process.

This is a draft version of thesis and almost complete version of
program.
