## PCL - surface - mesh reconstruction

This is a repository for my master's thesis. Here you can find program
```mesh-reconstruction``` which uses ```PCL``` [Point Cloud Library][1]
to construct mesh of triangles from pointcloud obtained with Microsoft
Kineckt camera and [RGBDSlam][2] program. [RGBDSlam][3] is installed as
part of ```ROS``` [Robot operating system][4]

This is a draft version of thesis and almost complete version of
program.

![alt text][project-description]

[project-description]: https://github.com/msvalina/pcl-surface-mesh-reconstruction/raw/master/latex/figures/project-description.jpeg "A picture is worth a thousand words. I used Stanford bunny a computer graphics 3D test model developed by Greg Turk and Marc Levoy in 1994 at Stanford University. It is available for free download in various formats"

### Goal
is to have 3D model of objects and scenes from multiple views. 

### Task 
is to evaluate functionality and quality of described process.
